A line of people at an amusement park ride.

The line is composed of members, represented as strings.
There is a front to the line, as well as a back.
When someone enters the line, place them at the end.
People may leave the line whenever they see fit, and those
behind them take their place. Given the above real-world information,
use an array data structure to code the following solution.

a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]

memberLine = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];

b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line.
In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike.

memberLine.push("Mary");

c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the
position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).

d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function
return if it does not find the item in the array?

function findMember(memberLine, searchPerson){
 if(memberLine.indexOf(searchPerson) === -1){
  console.log("This member is not currently in line.");
 } else {
  return memberLine.indexOf(searchPerson);
  }
}

findMember(memberLine, "Josh"); //returns 2, the index of "Josh"
findMember(memberLine, "Emily"); //returns an error message "This member is not currently in line"

e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front
of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?

function handleMemberCut(memberLine, newMember, memberAllowingCut) {
  const indexToMove = memberLine.indexOf(memberAllowingCut);
  memberLine.splice(indexToMove, 0, newMember);
}

f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from
the array?

function handleMemberLeaving(memberLine, memberLeaving) {
  const indexToRemove = memberLine.indexOf(memberLeaving);
  memberLine.splice(indexToRemove, 1);
}

Provide another real-world example that you can model
using a data structure.

The organization of Morse Code is a binary tree.

How would your data structure allow developers to access
and manipulate the data?

People with disabilities are able to use Morse Code on smart phones
to use the ability to participate in class.
