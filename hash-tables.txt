1. What is a hash table?
A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs.

2. What is hashing?
Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a
specific object from a group of similar objects.

3. How does a hash table store data?
It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in
which an element will be inserted or searched

4. How are hash tables and objects different?
Objects are used when the number of data entries are static. Hash tables
are used when data entries are variable.


5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to
store each of the following pieces of data:

A list of pets and their unique names. Hash Table
The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend. Object
The name and location of every company in a given city. Hash Table
All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual. Hash Table
The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact. Object


6. Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name,
address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone
numbers. Store this information in a hash table. given a phone number, get name
address of a customer.

var contactsToAdd = {
    1234567890: ['John Smith','555 4th street'],
    5555555555: ['Jane Smith', '555 4th street'],
    4444444444: ['Colin Hash', '555 hash street'],
    1234567897: ['Josey Wales', '555 ECMA street'],
    3333334444: ['John Doe', '555 5th street'],
    1112224445: ['Jane Doe', '555 5th street'],
};

var contactsHash = makeHashTable(10000);

for (var key in contactsToAdd) {
    contactsHash.add(key, contactsToAdd[key]);
}

console.log(contactsHash.find('1234567890'));

contactsHash.add('5641239871', ['Allen Hunn', '123 1st street Philadelphia, PA']);

console.log(contactsHash.find('5641239871'));

8. Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched
by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.

function createNewspaperData(publisher, publicationDate) {
  CREATE HashMapNewspaper
  STORE each publicationDate (key) in HashMapNewspaper with associated publisher (values)
}

function searchNewspaper(publicationDate) {
  IF HashMapNewspaper has publicationDate
    RETURN publicationDate and publisher
    ELSE PRINT "Sorry, publicationDate does not exist"
  ENDIF
}
