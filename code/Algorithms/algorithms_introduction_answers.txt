1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

-Making coffee;
  GET ground coffee
  GET filter paper
  GET water
  GET coffee machine
  GET mug

  SET filter paper in coffee machine
  SET ground coffee in filter paper
  SET water in water compartment of machine
  SET mug on placement pad in filter machine
  SET machine button to on


-Washing dishes;
GET dish soap
GET dish sponge
GET dishes
GET cloth

WHILE dishes are dirty
INPUT soap, sponge, cloth to dishes
END WHILE


A choice of your own.
-Doing laundry
  GET light clothes
  GET dark clothes

  PUT light clothes in washing machine
    SET to hot
      WHEN washing machine beeps
    REMOVE light clothes in washing machine
    PUT light clothes in dryer

  WHILE dryer is running
    PUT dark clothes in washing machine
      SET to cold
  END WHILE

TAKE light clothes out of dryer

PUT dark clothes in dryer




2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem.
It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who
created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example
(such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines;
what about each of your cases make them stand out?

-Facebook's algorithm ranks all available posts that can display on a userâ€™s News Feed based on how likely that user will have a positive reaction.
-Instagram's algorithm is based on interest, recency, and relationship
-Amazon's recommended item algorithm

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

An algorithm is efficient if it:
An algorithm is efficient if it:
-is able to minimize the number of steps needed to complete
-is very clear and easy to understand
-is able to accomplish a given goal with consistency and accuracy
