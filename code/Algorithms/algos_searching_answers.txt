1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
Finding your way in a phone book. Finding the first 'Smith'.
You would look through each entry until the first 'Smith' is
found.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
A real-life scenario would be searching for your book in a library. If you have
10 racks of books organized in alphabetical order, and you don't know which racks contains
your book, check the middle rack. If not found, eliminate half of the racks based on alphabetical
order of your book and search the middle of the halved racks. Continue the process until
the book is found.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint,
how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
It would take seven iterations, since the for loop would go through each letter and
check if it is the correct one. Since G is the seventh letter in the collection.

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
It would take three iterations. First iteration would eliminate collection
from A to D. The search would start again with middle being F. Second iteration would
eliminate letters E and F. Third iteration will find value G, since G is the middle, first, and last value.

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
Since the collection is unsorted, a linear search is better because the algorithm
will loop through each item and check against inout value.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose
between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
Since the collection is sorted, binary search must be used for a collection this large.
Binary search can effectively half of the collection after one iteration, if necessary.
It can continue halving the collection as the middle changes and checked against input value.


Programming Assignment:

You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word
"Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow
you to win the bet.

var arr = ["albatross", "bouquet", "cat,", "dog", "environment", "face", "giraffe"]

 function findWord(arr, word) {
   var low = arr[0];
   var high = arr[arr.length -1];

   while (low <= high) {
     var mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high)) /2;
     mid = Math.round(mid);

     if (arr[mid] > word) {
       high = arr[mid - 1]

     } else if (arr[mid] < word) {
       low = arr[mid + 1]

     } else {
       return arr[mid]
     }
   }
   return "Word not found"
 }

 findWord(arr, "albatross");

You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only
white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help
you net the right fish.

var petStore = ['fighting fish', 'goldfish', 'koi', 'gar', 'minnow', 'white-spotted goldfish', 'oscar', 'gourami'];

 function findFish(arr, target) {
   for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
     value = arr[i];
     if (value === target) {
       var result = i;
     }
   }
   return result;
 }

 findFish(petStore, 'white-spotted goldfish');
