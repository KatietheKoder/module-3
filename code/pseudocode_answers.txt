Short Answer
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode Programmers use pseudocode to
develop algorithms and to brainstorm code before building a program
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen? Nothing

Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT 2 numbers
  CALL max number
OUTPUT answer


2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
FOR each number 1-100
   COMPUTE result until 100
THEN print the result to the console


3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
 FOR name in phoneEntry
   IF phoneEntry equals name
   Return phoneEntry
  END IF
END FOR

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question,
implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function phoneEntry(name) {
  for (let i = 0, i < name.length, i++) {
    if (name == phoneEntry[i]) {
      return phoneEntry[0];
    }
  };
}
